1.1  Why is the computer used by so many different people, in so many different professions?
     Because computer can be programmed, they are not designed to do just one job, but any job their programs tell them to do.
1.2  List the five major hardware components of a computer system.
     The central processing unit(CPU), Main memory, Secondary storage devices, Input devices, Output devices
1.3  Internally, the CPU consists of what two units?
     Control Unit and Arithmetic and Logic Unit
1.4  Describe the steps in the fetch/decode/execute cycle
     Fetch    The CPU's control unit fetches, from main memory, the next instruction in the sequence of programming instructions.
     Decode   The instruction is encoded in the form of a number. The control unit decodes the instruction and generates electronic signal.
     Execute  The signal is routed to the appropriate component of the computer(such as the ALU, a disk drive, or some other device). The signal causes the component to perform a operation.
1.5  What is a memory address? What is its purpose?
     Address is a unique number that assigned to each byte in main memory. It makes storing and retrieving data easier.
1.6  Explain why computers have both main memory and secondary storage.
     Main memory is commonly known as random-access memory or RAM. The CPU is able to quickly access data stored at any random location in RAM. RAM is usually a volatile type of memory that 
     is used only for temporary storage while a program is running. When the computer is turned off, the contents of RAM are erased.
     Secondary storage is a type of memory that can hold data for long periods of time, even there is no power to the computer. Programs are normally stored in secondry memory and loaded into
     main memory as needed.
1.7  What are the two general categories of software?
     System Software and Application Software.
1.8  What fundamental set of programs control the internal operations of the computer's hardware?
     Operating Systems.
1.9  What do you call a program that performs a specialized task, such as virus scanner, a file-compression program, or a data-backup program?
     Utility Programs.
1.10 Word processing programs, spreadsheet programs, e-mail programs,web browsers, and game programs belong to what category of software?
     Application Software.
