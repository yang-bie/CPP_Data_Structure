1.1 Why is the computer used by so many different people, in so many different professions?
    Because computer can be programmed, they are not designed to do just one job, but any job their programs tell them to do.

1.3 Internally, the CPU consists of what two units?
    Control Unit and Arthimetic and Logic Unit
1.4 Describe the steps in the fetch/decode/execute cycle
    Fetch    The CPU's control unit fetches, from main memory, the next instruction in the sequence of programming instructions.
    Decode   The instruction is encoded in the form of a number. The control unit decodes the instruction and generates electronic signal.
    Execute  The signal is routed to the appropriate component of the computer(such as the ALU, a disk drive, or some other device). The signal causes the component to perform a operation.
